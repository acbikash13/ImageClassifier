# Image Classification App

## Overview

The **Image Classification App** is a deep learning-based project that classifies images into 6 different categories using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app allows users to upload an image and instantly receive predictions of the imageâ€™s category. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

Check out the live version of the app [here](https://classiffyimages-d4g0bednaaaaevc8.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net/).
## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images via the web interface.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The app instantly classifies the uploaded image into one of the predefined categories.
- **Model**: Utilizes a CNN model trained on a large dataset of labeled images.
- **Technology Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask, HTML/CSS for front-end

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) or Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- **Data**: Image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10)
- **Deployment**: Azure
